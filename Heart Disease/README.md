# Exploratory Data Analysis For Heart Disease-
I have perform EDA on heart disease to understand each features and their relation with each other as well as with the target feature.


# Dataset Information-
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.


# Attribute Information:-
1.Age: age in years.
2.Sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female).
3.CP: chest pain type (Value 0: typical angina; Value 1: atypical angina; Value 2: non-anginal pain; Value 3: asymptomatic).
4.Trestbps: resting blood pressure in mm Hg on admission to the hospital.
5.Chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl.
6.Fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false).
7.Restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (Value 0: normal; Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality; Value 2: probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy).
8.Thalach: maximum heart rate achieved.
9.Exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no).
10.Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
11.Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 0: upsloping; Value 1: flat; Value 2: downsloping).
12.Ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy.
13.Thal: thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect).
14.Target: heart disease (1 = no, 2 = yes)
